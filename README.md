# p1-start
#Starter code for Project 1 in Spring 2020.
*This is a REAMDE file 
*Any software dependencies for the project
This project requires the use of the Linux based bascottie BSU computers which have been used remotely through Cisco AnyConnect VPN software. The terminal used was MobaXterm in which matplotlib and numpy files were used

*How to git it *How to run it, 
The adjusted data can be run through python program in the terminal

*An example of how to run the code, and what the user should expect
python plot.py raw data/(individual data files)
This will show and save the stress strain curve of the material tests along with the Young's Modulus superimposed. The terminal will then print out the slope of the Young's Modulus

*2 things I've learned from this project
I learned that there is a wealth of information online with programmers coming together to help each other out through their individual problems. I also learned python was able to be used outside the jupyter notebook, within the command line terminal.
